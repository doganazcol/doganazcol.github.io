    Me and my friends are casually building <strong>BerkeleyWork</strong> — a platform where Berkeley students can find classmates based on compatible work habits.  
    You can check it out (and give us honest feedback!) here:

    While I was interning at SF based  <a href="https://fal.ai/">fal.ai</a> (now a Unicorn), along with my fellow intern, we built a tool that curates 2M+ 8K & 16K high-definition images over our Spring Break 🏝️ and named it "Cancun". The vision was (hopefully) solving the bottleneck of finding quilty image data for Vision ML models.

    Contributed to publishing a fun book called <strong>"A Guide for Future Founders"</strong>, where we analyzed common patterns of successful startups in Silicon Valley with our co-author <strong>Luka Kowalski</strong> (currently VP at Oracle).  
    You can find it on Amazon →

    While coordinating <strong>Shomit Ghose’s</strong> Applied AI and Data-Driven Business course under the Sutardja Center for Technology and Entrepreneurship, Shomit and I turned one of our casual chats into a podcast about navigating Silicon Valley in the age of AI.
