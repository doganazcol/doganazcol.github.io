    <p>Hi! I’m Naz — a 4th year undergraduate at UC Berkeley and an AI/ML Researcher at the 
    <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a>, 
    advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/" target="_blank">Trevor Darrell</a> and 
    <a href="https://joeygonzalez.com/" target="_blank">Joey Gonzalez</a> in the 
    <a href="https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Sky Computing Lab (SkyLab)</a>. 
    I’m interested in large language model behaviour and characteristics, as well as optimizing machine-learning systems for specific domains.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was part of the <strong>Web Defense, Knowledge & AI</strong> team under <strong>Microsoft Security</strong>, 
    where I worked on building, optimizing, and deploying <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong> — 
    along with our side-project of restoring our cubicle with string lights from arcade machines ✨.</p>

    <p>Find me on <a href="https://github.com/doganazcol">GitHub</a> or

    <h2 style="text-transform: lowercase; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">research</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Building a novel <strong>prompt-based framework</strong> that enables LLM models to disguise each other's distinctive behavioral patterns without fine-tuning. 
        <a href="https://github.com/lisadunlap/dementor" target="_blank">[Dementor]</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        Extending an automated system to <strong>quantify qualitative differences in LLMs</strong>, developing algorithms to systematically analyse and compare their behaviours and responses. 
        <a href="https://github.com/lisadunlap/VibeCheck" target="_blank">[VibeCheck]</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Building Project AEI: Emotional Intuition</strong> — Research centered on emotional intelligence in conversational AI systems, focusing on modeling human affective patterns and empathy-driven responses with 
        <strong>NVIDIA Inception company KOER AI</strong>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Worked in the AI team of <strong>Professor Dan Garcia’s research group</strong> at UC Berkeley, focusing on combinatorial and computational game theory. 
        <strong>Trained neural networks</strong> for generating graphical and parameterizable game applications and <strong>developed algorithms</strong> to compress databases.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I also hold an <strong>international patent</strong> with my high school best friend for an electrochemical methanol bioindicator — thanks to Yasar University researchers who let two high-schoolers use their labs :D</p>
