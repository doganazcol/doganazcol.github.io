    <p>Hi! I’m Naz — a senior at UC Berkeley and an AI/ML Researcher at the <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)</a> lab. I’m interested in large language model behaviour and characteristics, as well as optimizing machine-learning systems for specific domains.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was part of the <strong>Web Defense, Knowledge & AI</strong> team under Microsoft Security, where I worked on building, optimizing, and deploying <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong> — along with our side-project of restoring our cubicle with string lights from arcade machines ✨.</p>

    <p>Currently, I’m exploring how to combine machine learning with practical tools for automation and interaction design.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Built an agent testing harness that reduced failure rate by 35%</li>
      <li>Designed evaluation tools for retrieval and LLM ranking</li>
      <li>Working on human-centered AI interfaces</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Find me on <a href="https://github.com/doganazcol">GitHub</a> or <a href="mailto:yourname@email.com">email</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Building a novel <strong>prompt-based framework</strong> that enables LLM models to disguise each other's distinctive behavioral patterns without fine-tuning.

      <li>
        Extending an automated system to <strong>quantify qualitative differences in LLMs</strong>, developing algorithms to systematically analyse and compare their behaviours and responses.

        <em>Artificial Intelligence Researcher — Dec 2023 – Aug 2024 · Berkeley, California</em><br>
        Worked in the AI team of <strong>Professor Dan Garcia’s research group</strong> at UC Berkeley, focusing on combinatorial and computational game theory.  
        Created and trained new neural networks on large datasets to improve <strong>GAMESMAN’s</strong> accuracy — a system for generating graphical and parameterizable game applications.  
        Implemented a new <strong>exceptions-table strategy</strong> that compressed existing databases and optimized the codebase for scalability and efficiency.  
        <br><br>
        As part of <strong>KOER AI (NVIDIA Inception)</strong>, designed, optimized, and trained <strong>conversational AI models</strong> using PyTorch and Vertex AI — enhancing performance metrics and deploying scalable solutions for real-world applications with a focus on emotional intelligence and empathy-aware interaction.
